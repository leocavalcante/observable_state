## But this time

- 🧰 State changes are handled using [encapsulation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html) on plain-old objects.
- ✔️ You can freely test your state and its changes, like pure Dart; because **IT IS** pure Dart.
- 🎯 Notify only the specific `State`s that are observing the triggered change, **NOT** the entire Widget tree.
- 💧 No Streams or new Widgets, it is purely `State` and `setState()`; like Vanilla, but in a **Centralized** and **Predictable** state container. **Your Container!**

## How it works

It's a sweet, sweet sugar on top of the battle-tested **Observer pattern.** Your state is stored in a list of `Observable`s of a given subject (see `Change` below) and it's `setState()` is called only when your Model explicit tells to notify about that change.

- **It _isn't_ BLoC**, but you still can maintain, test and visualize your Business Logic away from the UI.
- **It _isn't_ Flux** _(Redux/Rx/Stream)_, but you still can control data in an unidirectional flow.

## Get started

The fact is: **state is hard!** Probably the hardest thing (after naming, of course). This is why things like BLoC, Flux/Redux and ScopedModel appears; to help you solve that.

And that is why **observable_state** is here too.

### Installing

```yaml
dependencies:
  observable_state: ^0.2.0
```

### State modeling

```dart
class MyState {
  int counter;
}
```

From a simple model like that, to add **observable_state** super-powers you just need to:

```dart
class MyState extends Observable<Changes> {
  int counter;
}
```

Then make sure you declare what changes to your state are:

```dart
enum Changes {
  increment,
}
```

Even better, remember that [changes are handled by encapsulation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html):

```dart
enum Changes {
  increment,
}

class MyState extends Observable<Changes> {
  int _counter;
  int get counter => _counter;

  void increment() {
    _counter++;
  }
}
```

### How to notify about the `increment` change?

_Observable state_ borrows the same Flutter API for local state (`setState()`) with a slight difference: the `notify` argument:

```dart
enum Changes {
  increment,
}

class MyState extends Observable<Changes> {
  int _counter;
  int get counter => _counter;

  void increment() {
    setState(
      () => _counter++,
      notify: Changes.increment,
    );
  }
}
```

That is it. Your `Observable` is notifying about `MyState` changes.

### How to listen to then?

**Here comes the `StateObserver`**.

`StatelessWidget`s are state-less as the name suggests. We are not going to mess with them adding Streams or whatever. Actually, even the `StatefulWidget` remains the same. We are going to **super-power** the `State` only!

```dart
class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends StateObserver<MyStatefulWidget, MyState, Changes> {
  @override
  List<Changes> get changes => [Changes.increment];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Observable state #${state.counter}')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Counter: ${state.counter}')),
      floatingActionButton: Builder(
        builder: (context) {
          return FloatingActionButton(
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: () {
              state.increment();
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Note that we are extending `StateObserver` instead of `State` and we are given a list of changes we are interest in, like `Changes.increment`.
`StateObserver` already got the `state` so we can get `counter` and we can call `increment()` on it as well.
Whenever `increment()` is called, since it notifies about `Changes.increment`, whoever `Observer` (like a `StateObserver`) is observing this change, it will automatically calls its inner `setState()` method, then rebuilding it.

### Where does the `state` comes from?

The last piece: `ObservableProvider`.

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ObservableProvider(
      state: MyState(),
      child: MaterialApp(home: MyStatefulWidget()),
    );
  }
}
```

It's an `InheritedWidget` responsible to provide our state from its context.

## Fine-grained control

The example above works great, but because it is very simple. When using things like `FutureBuilder`s and/or Animations. No longer will be a good idea to have your entire State UI rebuilt after a change. You don't need to rebuild the entire `Scaffold` and its `AppBar` just because of the `body`.

That is why **Observable state** comes with 3 more constructions for a fine-grained control over what should be rebuilt on changes.

- `ObserverBuilder`
- `bind()` & `bindWidget()`
- `observableStateOf()`

### ObserverBuilder

Works like any other builder in Flutter (`StreamBuilder`, `FutureBuilder`, `AnimatedBuilder` etc), each builder is specialized on a task and the `ObserverBuilder` job is to provide the Observable state from the `ObserverProvider` and listen for changes:

```dart
ObserverBuilder<MyState, Changes>(
  changes: [Changes.increment],
  builder: (context, state) => Text(state.counter.toString())
);
```

Now just this little piece of `Text` will rebuild after `Changes.increment` is notified.

### bind & bindWidget

They work almost like `ObserverBuilder`, but they **don't listen for changes**. They just provide (or _binds_) the current state to a function (`bind`) or a builder `bindWidget`. This is useful when you need just the state and **don't need to listen for changes**.
`bind()` is special, because it returns a `void Function()`, this is useful to immediately pass to `on*` listeners, like:

```dart
RaisedButton(
  onPressed: bind<MyState>(context, (state) => state.increment())
  child: const Icon(Icons.add),
);
```

```dart
AppBar(
  title: bindWidget<MyState>(context, (context, state) => Text(state.title)),
);
```

### observableStateOf

This is a generalized construction to get the state from whatever place you are. It is a sugar over: `ObservableProvider.of<MyState>(context).state`.

```dart
StreamBuilder(
  stream: observableStateOf<MyState>(context).someStream,
);
```

**That is it! You're ready to Rock! 🎸**

`Observable` has no dependency at all with any Flutter APIs, so you can unit test your state using plain-old `test` package. And you can test your Widgets using a mock or a real state without any hassle.

Feel free to, and I'd be glad if you, try it and leave some feedback. Just be aware that while on early stages, API may change.
